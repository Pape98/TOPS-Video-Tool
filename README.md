# TOPS Video Tagging Tool


## Context

The Math Department at Texas A&M is home to 5000 hours of streaming video content dedicated to helping students in math outside of the classrooms. These videos have been developed by various professors throuhout the years. The department is in the process of inclusing these videos as part of the Virtual Math Learning Center which will be a sub-branch of the Math Learning Center.

## Problem

Because these videos were recorded by different professors, they were not categorized by courses nor topics. Moreover, some of the videos were recorded using outdated software, resulting in poor video and audio quality. When I joined the project, the initial idea was to have undergraduates students watch the video and and evaluate the video by filling in a single form (made in google spreadsheet) for each video. Students evaluated sound quality, video quality, and other features. Moreover, graduate students were hired to watch video, tag them with math keywords, and categorize them by courses. The problem with the initial workflow was that it created way too many documents and folders. A shared drive was used as a database but access was limited. Each video had a spreadsheet for evaluation, a word document for its keywords and courses, and a folder that contained its handouts.

## 

My solution was to create a single web interface that everyone could access and edit the same database. This allowed undergraduates to create a single instance for each video, and graduate students used the same instance to also do their work. This eradicated the need to create multiple instances.
